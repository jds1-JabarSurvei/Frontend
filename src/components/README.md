# Components
This folder is for storing components used in a page. Please group each components in its own page folder. For each folder, add its own `style.css` file to style components in that folder. Components filename should be in <b>Pascal Case</b>(Capitalize first letter of filename and each word). 

Example: If login page has 2 components which is `LoginForm.js` and `LoginButton.js`, the folder structure will be like this.

```
components
|--login
|----LoginForm.js
|----LoginButton.js
|--Registration
|----RegistrationComponent1.js
|----RegistrationComponent2.js
|--Dashboard
```
